# Radium Sandbox

This application has several purpose:
 - It allow to load and vizualize 3d models using Radium IO and Engine packages.
 - It demonstrates standard graphical tools offered by the Radium-Engine: gizmos, picking, skeletal animation, keyframing, renderering, ...
 - It offers a graphical front-end to load and use plugins easily. Just add your plugin to the Plugin path (see graphical user interface), its interface will appear in the command panel and you will be able to use it.

Internally, we use this application as an integration and testing application for the Radium-Engine libraries.

**Warning**: This application aggregates several tools that might not need to be combined in practice, so you may expect better performances by using a custom application containing only the desired tools.
