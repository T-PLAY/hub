Why use it ?
============

Because this library allows the abstraction of the different data formats acquired by a number of sensors
without worrying about the different sensor manufactor drivers.
If you want to write processing/visualising applications without worrying about the acquisition part, 
this library is made for you. 
It is a reusable and modular system.
It also allows several machines to work on the same data in real time.
