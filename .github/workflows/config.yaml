# To convert a yaml to json, execute the following command in a terminal

# >>>> Test case using job strategy syntax
#
# The following syntax which is derived from what we use in a job strategy
#
#include:
#  builder-image: [ 'paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-tiny:0.0.173', 'paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-tiny:0.0.175' ]
#  pack_cli_version: [ 'v0.30.0-rc1' ]
#
# and which corresponds to what we declare as job/step
# strategy:
#  matrix:
#   builder-image: [ 'paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-tiny:0.0.173', 'paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-tiny:0.0.175' ]
#   pack_cli_version: [ 'v0.30.0', 'v0.30.0-rc1' ]
#
# dot not work as github expects an array of values and will raise this error: A mapping was not expected !!!
#

#
# This is why the yaml file should be declared as such:

    # It is then needed to populate yourself all the combinations as we do hereafter
